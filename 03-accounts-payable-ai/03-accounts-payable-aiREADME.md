# Multilingual Accounts Payable Automation

## Problem:
Invoices were received in multiple languages and processed manually.

## Solution:
Built an AI pipeline using:
- OCR + Tesseract  
- Language detection models  
- Azure cloud  
- NLP (spaCy)  
- Workflow routing system  

## Process:
1) Read invoice  
2) Detect language  
3) Extract key fields  
4) Route to correct department  
5) Capture approval/rejection  
6) Complete workflow automatically  

## Impact:
- Reduced processing time  
- Reduced translation effort  
- Faster approvals  

## Challenge:
Improving accuracy across multiple languages — solved using human feedback + model voting.

## Problem
Invoices arrived in multiple languages and were processed manually.

## Solution
End-to-end AI pipeline using:
- OCR (Tesseract)  
- Language detection models  
- NLP (spaCy)  
- Azure cloud workflow engine  

## Intelligent Workflow
1) Scan invoice  
2) Detect language  
3) Extract fields  
4) Route to department  
5) Capture approval  
6) Auto-complete payment workflow  

## AI Innovations
