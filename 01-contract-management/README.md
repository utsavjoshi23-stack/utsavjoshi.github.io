# Contract Management Automation

Problem:
Managing NDAs and internal contracts across multiple countries and teams was slow,
manual, and expensive.

Solution:
Built an automated contract management workflow using:
- Microsoft Power Automate  
- SharePoint  
- Microsoft Copilot  

What I led:
- Requirements gathering with legal and operations teams  
- Workflow design  
- Success metrics definition  
- Stakeholder alignment across regions  

Key Features:
- Country-specific contract routing  
- Automated approvals  
- Template-based contract creation  
- Audit trail storage in SharePoint  

Business Impact:
- Saved licensing costs by using existing Microsoft stack  
- Faster turnaround time for new contracts  
- Easier onboarding of new contract types  

Challenges:
- Ensuring legal accuracy  
- Aligning workflows across countries
