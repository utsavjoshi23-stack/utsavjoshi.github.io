# Multilingual Accounts Payable Automation

Problem:
Invoices were received in multiple languages and processed manually.

Solution:
Built an AI pipeline using:
- OCR + Tesseract  
- Language detection models  
- Azure cloud  
- NLP (spaCy)  
- Workflow routing system  

Process:
1) Read invoice  
2) Detect language  
3) Extract key fields  
4) Route to correct department  
5) Capture approval/rejection  
6) Complete workflow automatically  

Impact:
- Reduced processing time  
- Reduced translation effort  
- Faster approvals  

Challenge:
Improving accuracy across multiple languages — solved using human feedback + model voting.
